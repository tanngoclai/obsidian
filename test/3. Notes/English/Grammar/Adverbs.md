Tell us about:

- When (time)
- How often (frequency)

# 1. How adverbs are used
- ***Manner*** are often formed by adding *-ly* to the adjective form and usually come after verbs:
		*carefully*
		*happily*
		*I plan for my trips **very carefully***
- ***Place*** usually come after verb:
		*I was the first time I have been **there***
- ***Time*** (*today, now, since 2000, for 3 minutes*) can go at the beginning or the end of a clause:
		*I had a very memorable trip last year*
- ***Frequency*** usually come before the verb but after *be* or an auxiliary verb:
		*He is **never** late*
		*I **often** travel for my job*
- Intensity affect the strength of adjectives or adverbs:
		*fairly, quite, rather, pretty*
		*very, extremely, highly, really*
		*absolutely, completely, totally*

   Manner -> place -> time
